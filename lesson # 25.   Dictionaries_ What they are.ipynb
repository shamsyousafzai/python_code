    "A dictionary works something like a list, but instead of a simple series of things, a dictionary is a series of pairs of things. Each pair contains a key—\"first name\", \"last name\" etc.—and a value—\"David\", \"Elliott\", etc. To pick something out of a dictionary, you specify a particular key and ask what value is paired with it. In other words, if the key is \"first name,\" for example, what is the value? Answer: \"David.\"\n",
